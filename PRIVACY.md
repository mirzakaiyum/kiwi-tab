# Privacy Policy for Kiwi Tab

**Last Updated:** January 21, 2026

Kiwi Tab ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This
Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and
disclosure of information when you use our browser extension.

## 1. No Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, share, or sell any of your personal data.**

- We do not use analytics or tracking software.
- We do not have servers that receive or store your browsing history, search
  queries, or personal settings.
- All data generated by your use of the extension (such as settings, layouts,
  and pinned sites) resides solely on your local device.

## 2. Third-Party Services and APIs

Kiwi Tab utilizes various third-party services to provide content and
functionality. Interactions with these services occur directly between your
browser and the service provider. We do not intercept or store this traffic.

### Search Functionality

The extension allows you to search the web using various providers (Google,
Google AI, DuckDuckGo, ChatGPT, Perplexity).

- When you perform a search, your query is passed directly to the chosen
  provider via URL parameters (e.g., `google.com/search?q=...`).
- We do not log or track your search history.

### Background Media

- **Pexels API**: We use Pexels to provide high-quality background images and
  videos. Requests for these media assets are made directly from your browser to
  the Pexels API. Providing these assets is the sole purpose of this
  integration.

### Widgets

Widgets (such as Weather, Sports, Finance, etc.) fetch data from third-party
public APIs. These requests are standard web requests made by your browser to
fetch the necessary information to display content.

### Disclaimer & Service Providers

Nothing is stored on our end, however we cannot control how the service
providers are using your data. You can refer to the privacy policy of each
provider below. The extension communicates with the following domains:

- **Google & Gemini** (`suggestqueries.google.com`, `gemini.google.com`)
- **DuckDuckGo** (`api.duckduckgo.com`)
- **OpenAI** (`chatgpt.com`)
- **Perplexity AI** (`www.perplexity.ai`)
- **Wikipedia** (`en.wikipedia.org`)
- **ESPN / Cricinfo** (`static.cricinfo.com`, `site.api.espn.com`)
- **Aladhan** (`api.aladhan.com`, `aladhan.api.islamic.network`,
  `aladhan.api.alislam.ru`)
- **Pexels** (`images.pexels.com`)

## 3. Local Storage & User Content

- **Settings & Configuration**: All your preferences (e.g., dock position,
  enabled widgets, theme settings) are stored locally in your browser. Some
  settings may also be synced to your Google account via Chrome Sync
  (`chrome.storage.sync`) if enabled, allowing your preferences to carry over to
  other devices.
- **Custom Wallpapers**: If you choose to upload your own images or videos for
  backgrounds, these files are saved locally in your browser's storage database
  (IndexedDB). They are **never** uploaded to any external server.
- **Pinned Shortcuts**: The shortcuts you pin to your dock are stored locally.
  Like settings, these may be synced across your devices via Chrome Sync if
  enabled. We have no affiliation with the websites you choose to pin.

## 4. Permissions

We request only the permissions strictly necessary for the extension to
function:

- `storage`: required to save your customized settings, pinned sites, and cached
  background assets locally on your device.
- `Location` (Optional): We may request access to your location only when you
  specifically enable features that require it (such as the Weather widget).
  This is used solely to provide relevant local data and is not stored on our
  servers.
